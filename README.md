# perpetual-learning
Client scripts for continuously downloading training data
# Running download_and_train.sh
* Currently download_and_train.sh is a dumb script that prints out what it _would_ be doing
# Setup
* Check out and run download_and_train.sh (currently a demo)
* cron_download_and_train needs put into /etc/cron.d
* Directories, paths, users, and other specifics need to be sorted out still
